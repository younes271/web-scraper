# web-scraper
A new repository created via Python script

Below is a simple Python code that uses BeautifulSoup library to scrape data from a website.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Make a request to the website
r = requests.get('https://www.your-website.com')

# Create a BeautifulSoup object and specify the parser
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'html.parser')

# Find all the desired tags
data = soup.find_all('tag-name')

# Loop through the data and extract necessary information
for item in data:
    print(item.text)
```
Replace `https://www.your-website.com` with the URL of the website you want to scrape and `tag-name` with the name of the HTML tag you are interested in. The `text` attribute contains the content inside the HTML tags.

Please note that this is just a simple example. Web scraping can be much more complex depending on the structure of the website and the data you want to extract. Also, remember to always check a website's `robots.txt` file (e.g. `https://www.your-website.com/robots.txt`) before scraping to ensure that you are allowed to do so and to respect the website's scraping policy.
